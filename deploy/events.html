There’s no experience of politics necessary at all and it’ll be a friendly introductory session to explain what a think tank is, how it works and what we do.
It’s an active session and we’ll equip you with the tools you need to get involved in politics and start bringing your scientific expertise to the world of government.
If you enjoy it then you can get involved in our first author groups working on the policy issues you’re interested in.</p></div></main></body></html>
