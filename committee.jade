          |Hi! I’m Chair of LFSP and am responsible for overseeing the organisation’s activities as well as guiding policy groups and getting involved in workshops and events.

          |I joined Imperial this year as a ‘Direct Entry’ student to the third year of the Medical course having finished my BA at Cambridge. I studied Preclinical Medicine for the first two years and History in third year focussing on Modern Political Thought, the African American Civil Rights Movement and Subsaharan Africa.
          br
          br
          |I’m particularly interested in the politics of healthcare systems, science’s impact on gender identities and the tension between democracy and expert-led decision making. Distressed by most strenuous exercise, I play tennis in the summer and my spare time is filled mainly by musical endeavours on the piano, guitar + harmonica.

          |I am doing a Masters in Science Communication, having studied biochemistry for my undergraduate degree at Manchester. I have spent also three years working in open access publishing. I am interested in how science communicators – from journalists to politicians, and of course scientists themselves – share knowledge with the public, and how society can ensure that we are all more able to make informed decisions about science policy.
