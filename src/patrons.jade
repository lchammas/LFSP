        p(class="first-paragraph").
          Stephen Curry, a native of Northern Ireland, is a professor of structural biology at Imperial College. His main research interests are in structural analysis using X-ray crystallography of the molecular basis of replication RNA viruses such as foot-and-mouth disease virus and noroviruses (which include the infamous ‘winter vomiting bug’).
        p.
          Curry is also a regular science writer. He writes about his research and the scientific life past and present on his Reciprocal Space blog (<a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry">http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry</a>) and at the Guardian (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stephen-curry">http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stephen-curry</a>). His writing often touches on the business of science and the larger social responsibilities of scientists, which has taken him into the debates on topics such as science funding, publishing and research evaluation. 
        p.
          In addition, Curry is a founder member and vice-chair of Science is Vital, and is on the board of directors of the Campaign for Science and Engineering, both organisations that seek to raise the profile of science in the UK.
