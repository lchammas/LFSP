          |I’m particularly interested in the politics of healthcare systems, science’s impact on gender identities and the tension between democracy and expert-led decision making. Distressed by most strenuous exercise, I play tennis in the summer and my spare time is filled mainly by musical endeavours on the piano, guitar + harmonica.

          |I am doing a Masters in Science Communication, having studied biochemistry for my undergraduate degree at Manchester. I have spent also three years working in open access publishing. I am interested in how science communicators – from journalists to politicians, and of course scientists themselves – share knowledge with the public, and how society can ensure that we are all more able to make informed decisions about science policy.
